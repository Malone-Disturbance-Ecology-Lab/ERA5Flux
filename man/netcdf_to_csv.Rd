\usage{
netcdf_to_csv(site_folder, output_filepath, site_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_folder}{\itemize{
\item (character) a folder for one site with netcdf data. The netcdf files can be of different variables and if different years so long as it is for one site.
}}

\item{output_filepath}{\itemize{
\item (character) filepath to where the output csv should be written
}}

\item{site_name}{\itemize{
\item (character) name of the site that will be concantenated onto csv filename (e.g. Us_TaS)
}}
}
\value{
.csv file of netcdf data within site folder of the characteristics described in the netcdf_df_formatter() function. The .csv file is located within the site_folder and has the file name format: siteID_startYear_endYear_variableName.csv For example, US-Ho1_2001_2020_tp_t2m.csv
}
\description{
netcdf_to_csv
}
\note{
This function requires netcdf_df_formatter to work.

This function grabs each netcdf file and runs netcdf_df_formatter on it. It builds a list of variables across all dataframes in the folder and joins data by time, filtering to return only full years of data.

Each csv file starts from the first hour of a year (e.g., 2000-01-01 00:00) and ends with the last hour of a year (e.g., 2020-12-31 23:00).

site_name <- "US_TaS"
output_filepath <- tempdir()
netcdf_to_csv(site_folder,output_filepath,"US_TaS")
