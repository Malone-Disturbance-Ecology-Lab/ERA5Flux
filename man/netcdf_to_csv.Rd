\title{Export NetCDF to CSV}
\usage{
netcdf_to_csv(site_folder = NULL, output_filepath = NULL, site_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_folder}{(character) A folder for one site with NetCDF data. The NetCDF files can be of different variables and of different years so long as it is for one site.}

\item{output_filepath}{(character) File path to where the output CSV should be written.}

\item{site_name}{(character) Name of the site that will be concatenated onto CSV file name (e.g. Us_TaS).}
}
\value{
.csv file of NetCDF data within the site folder. The .csv file has the file name format: siteID_startYear_endYear_variableName.csv. For example, US-Ho1_2001_2020_tp_t2m.csv. SiteID is determined from lat and lon coordinates in df.sitemetadata. Each CSV file starts from the first hour of a year (e.g., 2000-01-01 00:00) and ends with the last hour of a year (e.g., 2020-12-31 23:00).
}
\description{
Takes a directory of ERA5 .nc data as an argument and exports the data in CSV format. This function grabs each NetCDF file and runs \code{netcdf_df_formatter()} on it. It builds a list of variables across all data frames in the folder and joins data by time, filtering to return only full years of data.
}
\examples{
# Point to a folder containing ERA5 .nc files
site_folder <- system.file("extdata", package = "ERA5Flux")
# Specify a site name
site_name <- "US_TaS"
# Create a temporary directory to export our output to
output_filepath <- tempdir()

# Convert NetCDF data to a CSV file
netcdf_to_csv(site_folder, output_filepath, "US_TaS")

# Read the CSV back in
data <- read.csv(list.files(output_filepath, pattern = "US_TaS", full.names = T))
head(data)

}
