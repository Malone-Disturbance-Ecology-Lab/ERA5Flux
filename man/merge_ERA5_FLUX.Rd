\usage{
merge_ERA5_FLUX(filename_FLUX, filename_ERA5, varname_FLUX, varname_ERA5)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename_FLUX:}{the file name of AmeriFlux BASE data downloaded from https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/
filename_ERA5: a csv file of meterological data downloaded from ERA5 https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview
please note that the original ERA5 files are in .nc format. You may want to convert these files into csv format using the function 02_csv_conversion.R
varname_FLUX: variable names in AmeriFlux BASE data to be merged with ERA5 data
varname_ERA5: variable names in ERA5 data to be merged with AmeriFlux BASE data
please note that the length of varname_FLUX must be the same as the length of varname_ERA5; at the same location, varname_FLUX and varname_ERA5 should refer to the same variable despite AmeriFlux and ERA5 may use different names for the same variable. For example, for incoming shortwave radiation, ERA5 uses ssrd, but AmeriFlux uses SW_IN.}
}
\value{
dataframe with the following characteristics:

Datetime stamp column named "time" with the format: "\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S";
time step of the "time" column is the same with that of AmeriFlux file;
It also includes the columns of varname_FLUX, the columns of varname_ERA5
}
\description{
this function is used to merge data from AmeriFlux and data from ERA5, ensuring they have the same start and end of timestamp and timestep with AmeriFlux data

# first example
