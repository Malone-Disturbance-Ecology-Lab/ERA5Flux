\title{Get Land Proportion}
\usage{
get_land_proportion(nc_file = NULL, lat = NULL, lon = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nc_file}{(character) File path to the .nc file.}

\item{lat}{(numeric) Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees.}

\item{lon}{(numeric) Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.}
}
\value{
(data.frame) A data frame containing the land proportion.
}
\description{
This function is designed to return land proportion given a latitude and longitude.
}
\note{
In cycles of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) from CY41R1 (introduced in May 2015) onwards, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can be comprised of a mixture of land and inland water but not ocean. Grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of a water surface. In the latter case, the lake cover is used to determine how much of the water surface is ocean or inland water.

In cycles of the IFS before CY41R1, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can only be comprised of land and those grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of ocean. In these older model cycles, there is no differentiation between ocean and inland water.
