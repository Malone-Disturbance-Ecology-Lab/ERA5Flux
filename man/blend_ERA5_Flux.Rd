\usage{
blend_ERA5_Flux(
  merged_data = NULL,
  varname_FLUX = NULL,
  varname_ERA5 = NULL,
  blending_rule = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{merged_data}{(data.frame) A data frame that has a datetime stamp column named "time" with the format: "\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S". The time step of the "time" column is the same with that of AmeriFlux file. It also includes the columns of AmeriFlux and ERA5 data that were merged together.}

\item{varname_FLUX}{(character) A vector of variable names in AmeriFlux BASE data to be blended with ERA5 data.}

\item{varname_ERA5}{(character) A vector of variable names in ERA5 data to be blended with AmeriFlux BASE data.}

\item{blending_rule}{(character) There are four types of blending rules that can be used to blend AmeriFlux and ERA5 variables:
\itemize{
\item "lm": Linear regression with slope. Fits a linear model with slope, FLUX ~ ERA5, then only fills missing values in FLUX with predicted values from ERA5.
\item "lm_no_intercept": Linear regression without slope. Fits a linear model without slope, FLUX ~ ERA5, then only fills missing values in FLUX with predicted values from ERA5.
\item "replace": Replace Ameriflux variable with ERA5 variable.
\item "automatic": Checks for non-missing FLUX values. If â‰¥50\% present then uses "lm" approach. If <50\% present then fallback to "replace".
}}
}
\value{
(data.frame) A data frame with the following characteristics:
\itemize{
\item Time step of the "time" column is the same with that of AmeriFlux file.
\item It also includes the columns of \code{varname_FLUX}, the columns of \code{varname_ERA5}.
\item Variable column with the blending rule applied on it. Name of the blended column is similar to AmeriFlux column name but with addition of "_f".
}
}
\description{
This function is used to blend data from AmeriFlux and data from ERA5, ensuring they both have the same start and end timestamps. Please first make sure to run the merge function (\code{merge_ERA5_FLUX()}) first, because output of merge function will be used as input of this blending function.
}
\note{
Please note that the length of \code{varname_FLUX} must be the same as the length of \code{varname_ERA5}; at the same location, \code{varname_FLUX} and \code{varname_ERA5} should refer to the same variable despite the fact that AmeriFlux and ERA5 may use different names for the same variable. For example, for incoming shortwave radiation, ERA5 uses "ssrd", but AmeriFlux uses "SW_IN".

# First example
# Please first make sure to run the merge function (`merge_ERA5_FLUX()`) first, because output of merge function will be used as input of this blending function
# Point to AmeriFlux data

# Point to ERA5 data
filename_ERA5 <- system.file("extdata", "BR-Sa1_tp_2002_2011.csv", package = "ERA5Flux")
# List AmeriFlux variable(s) to be merged with ERA5
varname_FLUX <- c("P")
# List ERA5 variable(s) to be merged with AmeriFlux
varname_ERA5 <- c("tp")
# Merge AmeriFlux and ERA5 data together
