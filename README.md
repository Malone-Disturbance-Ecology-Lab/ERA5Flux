# ERA5_FLUX

The primary objective of this repo is to improve the utility of ERA5 data at flux site locations. 

Scripts are organized into the following groups
# 1. create df.sitemetadata file 00_sitemetadata
- df that contains site meta data (site code, lat, lon, start date, end data, varibles needed)
# 2. pre-Download for Files _01
- 01_start_end_time_padding (add 1 day to start and end dates for future time zone offset issues)
- 01_lat_lon_UTC_offset (add UTC offest to df.sitemetadata)
- 01_point_sample_check (pull land-sea_mask for one day)
- 01_ERA5_API (use ecmwfr pacakge with df.sitemetadata)
  
# ***DATA is Downloaded***

# 3. Data Processing for ERA5 _02
 notes for sam. 
 a- please name ERA data timestamp column (valid_time) as "time"
 b- format of time columne (that include both date and time) is 202001010000  so without any slashes 
 c- please provide the data in same units as ameriflux data. Here are the desired solar radiation(ssrd) in wm-2, air temp (t2m) in celsius, precip in mm

# 4. Flux Data Merging_03
- one function titled Merge_ERA5_FLUX
  - input variables (character): filename_FLUX, filename_ERA5
  - input variables (vector of character): varname_FLUX, varname_ERA5
  - input variables (vector of character): blending_rules
  - output variables: adding new columns to the FLUX file
- requirement of these input variables
  - varname_FLUX and varname_ERA5 should have the same length. These names of the same row should be matched.
  - blending_rules should have the same length with varname_FLUX and varname_ERA5. users should give rules for each variable.
  - options for blending_rules: "replace", "lm", "lm_no_intercept", "automatic"
